# StringCalculator-TDD
## This is a submission for StringCalculator Kata 

#### The list below are the cases which I have included

1.  Testing on method `calulator.add()`
2.  Testing on _Single Input_ eg:-`"2"`
3.  Testing on _Two Value_ separated by _single delimiter_  eg:-`"1,2"`
4.  Testing on _Multi Value_ separated by _single delimiter_ eg:-`"1,4,5,6"`
5.  Testing on _Two Delimiter_ **; and \n** eg:- `"1,2\n3"`
6.  Testing on _One Random Delimiter_ of length **1** eg:-`"//;\n1;2"`
7.  Testing on _Negative Number_ eg:- `"1,2,3,-4"`;
8.  Testing on _Number > 1000_ eg:-"`1,1002,12`";
9.  Testing on _One Random Delimiter_ of any length eg :-`"//[***]\n1***2"`
10. Testing on _Multiple Random Delimiter_ of single length eg:- `"//[*][,][@]\n1*2@3,4"`
11. Testing on _Multiple Random Delimiter_ of any length eg:- `"//[**][$]\n1**2$5"`

#### The flow of the commit messages(That are written at the end)

|No.|What is written|Meaning|
|---|---------------|-------|
|1|`RED`| Means TDD 1st phase where we write failing test case| 
|2|`GREEN`| Means written just enough code to pass previous test case|
|3|`REFACTOR`| Means the barely written code is refactored such that it do not break any other test cases|

#### What will you fing in commits?
1. `RED` commit message will have test cases.
2. `GREEN` commit message will have bare minimum code passing the previous test case.
3. `REFACTOR` commit message will have refactored code from the previous one such that it do not break the other testcase.
